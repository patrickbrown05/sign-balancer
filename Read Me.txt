In the folder there is the C++ source file algorithms project (working) which is the working code, 
the two given files to be scanned by the syntax scanner,
Hello_World and Hello_World_Wrong and finally Test which is another different text file that should have no syntac errors. 


Hello_World is the text file with the correct syntax.

Hello_World_Wrong is the file with the incorrect syntax.

Test is a text file that has correct syntax but it is different from hello world and hello world wrong

To run these files in the source code there is an input ifstream, all one must do is
change the line: input1.open(" and put the file name here");
